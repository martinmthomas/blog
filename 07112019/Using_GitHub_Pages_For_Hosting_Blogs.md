# Using GitHub Pages For Hosting Personal Blogs

hosting static web pages like blogs, simple online business catalogue, etc. even though we have been successfull in simplifying web hosting 
and inreducing the infrastructure costs in the last decade. Read this along with the fact that we have never paid for email services.

Recently, I came across the feature in Github called `Github Pages`.
