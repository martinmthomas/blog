# Using GitHub Pages For Hosting Personal Blogs
Have you ever thought of writing couple of blog posts, creating an online resume, or even creating a simple webpage to display details about your Business? Chances are that you might have abandoned the idea because it was a hobby and you did not want to pay monthly for it. 

I have been using Wordpress to write blog posts for more than a year now. It sparkled the thought that we do not have a $0 solution for 
hosting static web pages like blogs, simple online business catalogue, etc. even though we have been successfull in simplifying web hosting 
and inreducing the infrastructure costs in the last decade. Read this along with the fact that we have never paid for email services.

Recently, I came across the feature in Github called `Github Pages`.
